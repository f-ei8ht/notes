- Array is contiguous memory allocation of similar elements or data types
- how we can make 1d array in java

```java

int size = 100;
int a[] = new int[size];

int a[] = new int[100];

int[] a = new int[100];

int[] a = {1,2,3,4,5};

int a[];
a = new int[5];

a[0] = 3;
a[1] = 4;

```

- array is a linear data structure

```java
int [][] a = new int[2][2];
```

the memory given to will not depend on the value but on the number of elements given in the above example we have 2 and 2 that is 4 and for int we have 4 bytes so 4 * 4 it is 16 bytes
