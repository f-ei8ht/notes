Related to the project above, there are also some new features in Java 17 that are not yet supported by JPF. We have work in progress on branch `java-17`. Currently unsupported Java features include language features that are not supported at run time (e.g., records) and Java language features that are not fully analyzed (e.g., sealed classes). In this project, you would identify such unsupported features and extend JPF (jpf-core) to support them.
