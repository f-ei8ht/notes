Websites are built using three key files: **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and your **browser** is responsible for rendering these files to display web pages.

1. **How Websites Work:**
    - When you request a website (e.g., google.com), your browser retrieves **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files** from the web server.
    - The browser then processes these files to display the website correctly.
    
2. **The Three Core Web Technologies:**
    - **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** → Defines the content of a webpage (text, images, buttons, links).
    - **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** → Controls the appearance and styling (colors, fonts, layout).
    - **JavaScript** → Adds interactivity and functionality (search bars, buttons, animations).
    
3. **How Browsers Render Websites:**
    - The **HTML** file loads first, displaying raw content.
    - The **CSS** file then applies styles to make the page visually appealing.
    - Finally, the **JavaScript** file adds interactivity (e.g., search functionality on Google).
    
4. **Using Developer Tools:**
    - Browsers like **Google Chrome** have built-in **Developer Tools** that let you inspect and modify a webpage's HTML and CSS temporarily.
    - You can **right-click → Inspect** any element, edit its content, and see changes in real-time.
    - However, refreshing the page restores the original content, as changes are only local.

By understanding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can build and customize your own websites, making them look and function exactly as you want.
