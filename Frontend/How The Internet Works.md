The Internet is essentially a vast network of interconnected computers linked by wires, including massive undersea fiber-optic cables that transmit data using light signals.

1. **Clients & Servers:**
    - **Clients** are devices (like your computer or phone) that request information.
    - **Servers** are special computers that store and serve website data 24/7.
    
2. **How a Website Request Works:**
    - When you type a website (e.g., google.com) into a browser, your request is sent to your **Internet Service Provider (ISP)**.
    - The ISP forwards this request to a **DNS (Domain Name System) server**, which acts like a phonebook, translating website names into numerical **IP addresses**.
    - The DNS server finds the correct IP address and sends it back.
    - Your browser then makes a direct request to the web server at that IP address.
    - The web server responds with the required data, loading the webpage on your screen.
    
3. **Data Transmission:**
    - Data travels as electrical signals through wires or fiber-optic cables, sometimes even under the ocean.
    - These signals move at the speed of light, allowing instant communication worldwide.

In essence, the Internet is a massive network of connected computers exchanging data through physical cables, enabling fast and seamless access to websites and online services.
