###### HTML TIPS 
The file extension must be .html or .htm
MS-DOS and Windows 3.1 had limitations on the number of characters in a filename. (.exe, .bat, .bat, .zip, .txt)

The file name must be index.html because it's default path of our homepage or the root of our website.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title> Home Page </title>
     </head>
     <body>

- head => information about the html document
- title => title of the html document
- body => contains everything you want to display on the web page.
